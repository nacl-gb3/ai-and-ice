              "text": "The principal hitting the ICE agent immediately evokes shock, serving as a hook that keeps the audience watching. Similar to many other sensational news clips or videos created to cause social outrage, this short begins with a high level of tension brewing between the two parties involved: dutiful ICE agents and the determined public school. The principal is portrayed as the leader, protector, and hero in the video; the communicator aims to elicit a moral connection with the audience. The ICE agents, on the other hand, are shown as weak, apathetic, and unfocused. They are shown rushing into the entrance, seemingly without a purpose for what to do with the principal or the students, when the principal recklessly decides to hit one of the agents."

This is representative of other teachers, all around America, who are standing with their students who may be immigrants. The ethos of the video comes from the primary actor in the video being a principal of a school (a figure of authority, respect, and discipline). Furthermore, the tone of the principal is exemplified through his direct speech as well as the method of delivery; the principal yells in an angry, heated, and assertive manner. "

The purpose for this segment is to try to convince the audience that this is a real school environment, with children directly being affected by the issue at hand. The children seem to be of different age ranges and are exhibiting varying levels of engagement with the contention between the principal and the ICE agents; some students are even yelling directly at the ICE agents, supporting the principal’s efforts. The purpose of the students’ placement outside of the school building is to emphasize the level of disruption the ICE agents have caused this small, seemingly impoverished school."

Rhetorically, the video loses ethos when subtle inconsistencies like this occur, thereby weakening the audience's trust in the account, video, and content. If the audience catches the mistake, they are likely not to be persuaded by the video as they may have realized that it is AI-generated, or possibly staged, thinking it is a satirical or ironic representation. The fact that the child’s clothing appears near the end of the video lowers the chances of the audience pinpointing this mistake, which may have been an intentional measure taken by the communicator of the video."
