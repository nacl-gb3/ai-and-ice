The ice agents and the 'drag queens' are running with no trouble, not slipping on the road at all even though there is a large amount of snow on the sidewalks. One ice agent breaks off from the other, runs over the top of the car, and then lands on the road with no difficulty at all. This section is a show of ethos as it is displaying the 'drag queens' chasing ice agents with no other context beforehand. This is also a show of the creators message, that ice agents are being chased out by a well known group of people and the agents are not welcomed in this area. Lastly, it shows major stakeholders, the 'drag queens'. Drag queens are a huge part of many political and social debates, if this video were seen and shared by the wrong people, the community could get backlash for actions that they had no participation in."
