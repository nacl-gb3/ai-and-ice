The ice agents and the 'drag queens' are running with no trouble, not slipping on the road at all even though there is a large amount of snow on the sidewalks. One ice agent breaks off from the other, runs over the top of the car, and then lands on the road with no difficulty at all. This section is a show of ethos as it is displaying the 'drag queens' chasing ice agents with no other context beforehand. This is also a show of the creators message, that ice agents are being chased out by a well known group of people and the agents are not welcomed in this area. Lastly, it shows major stakeholders, the 'drag queens'. Drag queens are a huge part of many political and social debates, if this video were seen and shared by the wrong people, the community could get backlash for actions that they had no participation in."

It also allows for the context to be better understood, so that anyone who stumbles upon this video can get the version of the story that this creator made up. This can create many issues for actual reporters and people who watch the news. By including a 'reporter', the creator has made this video seem like a trustworthy source and that can harm those who watch it or are included in it. The tone is also set up by using this 'reporters' voice, as it makes it seem like this is a real and serious event happening. "

According to a Wired article, \"Currying political capital online involves demonstrating that the opinions you hold are widely held while also engineering viral content that aligns with your views...\"(Parham), this shows that even though the person who posts this may get negative feedback, those who are the subject of these videos may face real consequences.
