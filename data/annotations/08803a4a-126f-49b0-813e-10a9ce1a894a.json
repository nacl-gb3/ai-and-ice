Here we can infer that the elderly woman and the others on the block are all stakeholders in this situation. The audience would like know from current events that the ICE officers plan to arrest those who were deemed to have been in the country illegally, so they could conclude that the freedom of the elderly woman and of others who live on that block would be on the line. The elderly woman also presents herself as a heroic figure by claiming to be the force that prevents the ICE officers from harming those who live on the block. This heroic presentation can be seen as an appeal to ethos as the audience is more apt to see the woman in a positive light since she is trying to protect those who are vulnerable."

The uniforms of the ICE officers seem to have minor differences from one another with the one farther from the camera having an extra chest bar saying \"police\". Furthermore, the officer further away from the camera seems to have \"ICE\" listed twice on the top chest bar, reading \"ICEICE\". The contents of the top chest bar cannot be 100% confirmed, however, since the officer in front obscures the right side of the chest bar.

The choice of this setting likely is meant to hit closer to home for the audience, many of whom may live in apartments that are similar enough to the one depicted here. However, this building has numerous oddities that contribute to a case for this video being synthetic. The most notable oddity are the stair rails on the side melding into each other in an impossible manner. One rail extends parallel to the rail closest to the camera, while the other extends perpendicular to that rail. Furthermore, what seem to be windows on the side of the building are inconsistently sized between the lowest floor and higher floors. This video being perceived as fake could result potentially result in people dismissing the video completely and disregarding the message expressed in the video. "
