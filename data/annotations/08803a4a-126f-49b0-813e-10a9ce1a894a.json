(TODO: add citation) Here we\ncan infer that the old woman and the others on the block are all stakeholders\nin this situation. The audience would like know from current events that the\nICE officers plan to arrest those who were deemed to have been in the country\nillegally, so they could conclude that the freedom of the old woman and of\nothers who live on that block would be on the line. The old woman also presents\nherself as a heroic figure by claiming to be the force that prevents the ICE\nofficers from harming those who live on the block. This heroic presentation can\nbe seen as an appeal to ethos as the audience is more apt to see the woman in a\npositive light since she is trying to protect those who are vulnerable.\n"

For ethos, the old woman claims to have knowledge of\nthe rights that the laws of the United States gives her, so the audience is\nmore inclined to trust her conclusion due to her being informed of the topic of\nthis situation. For pathos, the old woman's statement appeals to the audience\nin the way that she claims that they also are familiar with the topic at hand,\nwhich presents the evidence that she uses in her argument (officers requiring\na warrant to perform an investigation) as common knowledge. Therefore, the\naudience would be more likely to side with the woman in this video because of\nthat common knowledge."
