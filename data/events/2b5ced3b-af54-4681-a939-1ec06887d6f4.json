          "text": "This video is depicting a group of 5 people wearing brightly colored jackets, chasing 2 Ice agents. There seems to be a person reporting about the chase that is ongoing. It depicts these people as the aggressors to the point that the agents have to run away, even running on top of a parked car. The video also seems to imply that because these people are wearing bright coats they are believed to be Drag Queens. The purpose of this video is to gain followers and engagement. The poster, Mike Wayne, seems to take the side of the public, but generally he makes these videos to get clicks or even negative views. He wants people to watch and share his content, which leads to the spread of misinformation. This video shows how people are spreading AI content that makes the public look like the aggressors. They never show any context before the moment that regular citizens get upset, so it seems as though they are getting mad for no reason. However, based on real life, oftentimes people become defensive when Ice agents are being aggressive. A rhetorical analysis can offer a perspective on how these videos showing a group of people to be the aggressors against Ice agents can be continuing a harmful rhetoric.\n"
